# Nation-State Database

This repository is a lightweight, high-performance SvelteKit prototype that renders a strict black-and-white, fullscreen world map in SVG. Clicking any country opens a resizable left info panel and triggers a smooth, D3-driven zoom of the right pane that highlights the selected nation while preserving surrounding context. It is a proof-of-concept for a modern nation information UI built with static assets only. No database. No server-side geometry work for the map route (client-side rendering only for the map).

In the future information about each country clicked will be opened, educating on the history, economy, current politics, ect. of each country available. This could be written by hand, or taken in by API's or Wikipedia information.
